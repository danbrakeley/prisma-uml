# emyann/typescript-generic-datastructures

As part of the effort to get this code base to work with a more modern version of prisma, this folder contains code copied from the `src` folder of [emyann/typescript-generic-datastructures](https://github.com/emyann/typescript-generic-datastructures).

The most recent published version of `typescript-generic-datastructures` was from Feb 5, 2020, and doesn't seem to play nice with typescript versions >=4.7.2. Copy the code here allowed it to be built with the same typescript version as the rest of the app.

Here's attribution/licensing information for this code, as extracted from the original [package.json](https://github.com/emyann/typescript-generic-datastructures/blob/master/package.json):

```json

  "name": "typescript-generic-datastructures",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "repository": "emyann/typescript-generic-datastructures",

}
```

No actual license text was included in the `typescript-generic-datastructures` github repo.
